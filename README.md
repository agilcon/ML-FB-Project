# ML-FB-Proyect

The goal of this project is to create a Python algorithm that compares different machine learning models for predicting soccer match results. The steps that will be followed to create this algorithm are:

Collect (using web scraping on fbref.com) and preprocess (using Pandas) historical soccer match data that will be used for prediction. This data should include information about the performance of the teams and players, form, injuries, and any other relevant variables for predicting match results.

Split the data into training and test sets. The training set will be used to train the machine learning models, and the test set will be used to evaluate the accuracy of the models.

Train the selected machine learning models (in this case, random forest, SVM, logistic regression, and neural networks) using the training set.

Use the test set to evaluate the accuracy of each model, using metrics such as precision, classification error, or the area under the ROC curve.

Compare the results obtained with each model and select the one with the highest accuracy.

Use the selected model to make predictions for soccer match results.
